Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced fully supervised medical image segmentation. However, this approach heavily relies on labor-intensive and time-consuming fully annotated ground-truth labels, particularly for 3D volumes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel probabilistic-aware weakly supervised learning pipeline, specifically designed for 3D medical imaging. Our pipeline integrates three innovative components: a Probability-based Pseudo Label Generation technique for synthesizing dense segmentation masks from sparse annotations, a Probabilistic Multi-head Self-Attention network for robust feature extraction within our Probabilistic Transformer Network, and a Probability-informed Segmentation Loss Function to enhance training with annotation confidence. Demonstrating significant advances, our approach not only rivals the performance of fully supervised methods but also surpasses existing weakly supervised methods in CT and MRI datasets, achieving up to 18.1% improvement in Dice scores for certain organs.")]),e._v(" "),n("img",{staticStyle:{display:"block",width:"105%",margin:"15px auto"},attrs:{src:"/projects/framework.png",alt:"Framework Image"}})]),e._v(" "),n("ProjectCard",[n("p",{staticStyle:{"font-family":"'Georgia', serif","font-weight":"bold","font-size":"22px"}},[e._v("How Effective and Robust is Sentence-Level Data Augmentation for Named Entity Recognition?")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[n("strong",[e._v("Runmin Jiang")]),e._v("â€ , Xin Zhang, Jiyue Jiang, Wei Li, Yuhao Wang.

However, they are difficult to adapt to token-level tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) because of the different semantic granularity and more fine-grained labels. Inspired by some mixup augmentations in computer vision, we proposed three sentence-level\ndata augmentations including CMix, CombiMix, TextMosaic, and adapted them to the NER task. Through empirical experiments on three authoritative datasets (OntoNotes4, CoNLL-03, OntoNotes5), we found that these methods will improve the effectiveness of the models if controlling the number of augmented samples. Strikingly, the results show our approaches can greatly improve the robustness of\nthe pre-trained model even over strong baselines and token-level data augmentations.
