Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced fully supervised medical image segmentation. However, this approach heavily relies on labor-intensive and time-consuming fully annotated ground-truth labels, particularly for 3D volumes. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative probabilistic-aware weakly supervised learning pipeline tailored for 3D medical image segmentation. Our pipeline consists of three key components. Firstly, we introduce a Probability-based Pseudo Label Generation scheme that synthesizes dense 3D segmentation masks from sparsely annotated point annotations. Secondly, we develop a Probabilistic Multi-head Self-Attention network to extract robust probability-driven features, forming the foundation of our Probabilistic Transformer Network. Lastly, we incorporate a Probability-informed Segmentation Loss Function that effectively  guides the training process by incorporating annotation confidence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in weakly supervised segmentation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.")]),e._v(" "),n("img",{staticStyle:{display:"block",width:"105%",margin:"15px auto"},attrs:{src:"/projects/framework.png",alt:"Framework Image"}})]),e._v(" "),n("ProjectCard",[n("p",{staticStyle:{"font-family":"'Georgia', serif","font-weight":"bold","font-size":"22px"}},[e._v("How Effective and Robust is Sentence-Level Data Augmentation for Named Entity Recognition?")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[n("strong",[e._v("Runmin Jiang")]),e._v("â€ , Xin Zhang, Jiyue Jiang, Wei Li, Yuhao Wang.

However, they are difficult to adapt to token-level tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) because of the different semantic granularity and more fine-grained labels. Inspired by some mixup augmentations in computer vision, we proposed three sentence-level\ndata augmentations including CMix, CombiMix, TextMosaic, and adapted them to the NER task. Through empirical experiments on three authoritative datasets (OntoNotes4, CoNLL-03, OntoNotes5), we found that these methods will improve the effectiveness of the models if controlling the number of augmented samples. Strikingly, the results show our approaches can greatly improve the robustness of\nthe pre-trained model even over strong baselines and token-level data augmentations.
